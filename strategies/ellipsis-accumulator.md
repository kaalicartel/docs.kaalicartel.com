# Ellipsis Accumulator

**Step 1:** The cartel will give away bonds that will vest $KAALI tokens in exchange for $EPX & $DDD

**Step 2:** The cartel will then vote-lock the DDD tokens for 4 weeks and start delegating them to a platform like votium or vote on gauges itself.

**Step 3:** After a EPX vote takes place, all bribe rewards will be sold off to acquire more $EPX and $DDD tokens.

**Step n**: The protocol repeats this for several weeks until it acquires a large treasury of EPX & DDD tokens.
